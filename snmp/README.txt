The files in this directory where once generated by the tool 'mib2c' [1].

However, they where edited afterwards to bind the generated template 
(a.k.a skeleton) code to the libdessert code. The generation of the skeletons
was guided by a tutorial available at [2]. The parameters used in generating
the skeletons are documented in the various dessert*Table-README*.txt files. 

Please find the associated SNMP MIB as ../DESSERT-MIB.txt.

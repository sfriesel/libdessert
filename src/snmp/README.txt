The files in this directory were generated by the tool 'mib2c' [1].

However, they where edited afterwards to bind the generated template 
(a.k.a skeleton) code to the libdessert code. The generation of the skeleton
was guided by a tutorial available at [2]. The parameters used in generating
the skeleton are documented in the various dessert*Table-README*.txt files.

You can find the corresponding SNMP MIB here: doc/DESSERT-MIB.txt.

This is an addition dependency for libdessert on android because the 
pthread library is not fully implemented in the bionic c library.

Source is from glibc 2.11.1 source packe and then adapted to use
pthread.h mutexes and conditions for locking.

Compiles to a static library libpthreadex.a and is to be included in the
build process of libdessert as an additional linker object.
